This bathroom is unquestionably competing for the best bathroom in Beverly. Most people don't even know it.

## The Space

Kid Dream's owners must have had some inspiration for a cute, fun bathroom to add to the customer experience. In addition to being the nicest neighborhood baristas around, the bathroom delivers. For such a small place, the size is astounding. It actually makes me want to ask about the thought process. There's an intentionally small space to sit, stand, and sip, but I truly wonder if the bathroom square footage outsizes the front of house. They're also operating a small kitchen and dang good coffee back there. Why have such a large bathroom?

## The Details

That was a tangent. But, thoughtful and intentional or not, the size adds to this John's luxury. There's a full-length mirror with a Taylor Swift song quote stickered on, but the vibe maintains. There's a small cabinet (equipped with extra TP if they run out) and some nice bathroom spray and a subtle oil diffuser. Sounds nice, right? Wait until you use the fucking handsoap. They're rockin' with the nicest handsoap of any coffee shop in the world, I'd wager. They are using [Firsthand](https://firsthandsupply.com), a Beverly native's company (check them out, and once you see the prices you'll really savor the Kid Dream bathroom experience). Even outside of bathrooms, it's Beverly's #1 free customer perk, imo. Second being Soma's free bread and hummus.

## The Verdict

Despite being in a bathroom that may legit be within 10 feet of every single person in the place, it's equipped to drop all concerns. So, go ahead. Have some coffee. Use their John. Drop your concerns. Spray. Lather some handsoap. And use the *paper towels* (you'll notice this is my preference over a hand dryer), and go have yourself a great day.
