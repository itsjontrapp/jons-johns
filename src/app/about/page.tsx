          Welcome to Jon&apos;s Johns — a blog dedicated to the most underrated part of any
          dining or public experience: the bathroom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Good lighting matters. Quality hand soap is a game changer. A warm towel over a
          jet-engine blower? That&apos;s civilization. This blog takes the things most people
          overlook and puts them front and center.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every review covers the full experience — from the vibe and ambiance to the scent,
          the soap, and yes, whether they sprung for hand lotion. Each location also gets a
          unique spotlight category that captures what makes it stand out (or fall flat).
        </p>
        <p>
          Is this silly? Absolutely. But someone has to do it.
