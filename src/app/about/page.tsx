          Look, nobody reviews bathrooms. That&apos;s the whole point. You can find a thousand
          Google reviews about the coffee or the pasta, but nobody&apos;s telling you about the
          handsoap. Nobody&apos;s telling you if they sprung for paper towels or stuck you with
          one of those jet-engine hand dryers. I am.

        <p>
          Jon&apos;s Johns is about the full experience. The vibe when you walk in. The lighting.
          The scent. Whether there&apos;s actually TP stocked or you&apos;re rolling the dice. These
          things matter, and honestly, the bathroom says a lot about a place. If they care about
          the room most people overlook, they probably care about everything else too.
        </p>

          Every review breaks down the categories that matter: ambiance, cleanliness, soap and
          amenities, the drying situation, all of it. Each spot also gets a spotlight for whatever
          makes it uniquely great (or uniquely terrible). And yeah, I&apos;ll say it if the
          handsoap is fucking incredible.
        </p>

          Is this a bit ridiculous? Sure. But someone had to do it, and honestly, once you start
          noticing this stuff, you can&apos;t stop.
